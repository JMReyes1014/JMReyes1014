## 🚀 About Me
I aspire to be a successful software developer and/or machine learning expert. I build my projects one step at a time, I enjoy learning new things and squishing bugs is my specialty (cries in 6 hours). I'm passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Full-Stack Web Development. I love building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems, whether it's deep learning models for plant disease detection or NLP-driven AI assistants.
